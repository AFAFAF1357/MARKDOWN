BACKSLASH ESCAPES  
\*literal asterisks\*  
*literal asterisks*  
Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown’s formating syntax.
Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:  
\ backslash  
` backtick  
* asterisk  
_ underscore  
{} curly braces  
[] square brackets  
() parentheses  
# hash mark  
+ plus sign  
- minus sign (hyphen)  
. dot  
! exclamation mark  

FENCED CODE BLOCKS
```javascript
function test() {
console.log("look ma`, no spaces");
}
```
Markdown coverts text with four leading spaces
into a code block; with GFM you can wrap your code
with ``` to create a code block without the
leading spaces. Add an optional language identifier
and your code with get syntax highlighting.
